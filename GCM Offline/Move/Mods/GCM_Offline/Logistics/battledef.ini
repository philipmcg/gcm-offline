; This is done for every man lost in battle
; This is modified by factors in unitattributes.csv
CMBaseLoss=21
; This modifier is multiplied by the percentage of men lost, then by the morale loss
; So 100 with 50% of men lost and modified loss of 10 would mean a total 15 point loss
; So this value means take 100% of the percent lost modifier
CMPctMenRemainingMod=50
; Lastly we modify for where the fire came from, this value is the percent of the remaining value to use
CMPctFrontFire=41
CMPctRearFire=41
CMPctFlankFire=250
; So the final formula is: 
; result = BaseLoss + unitattributes modifiers
; result = Random( result - randfact, result + randfact )
; the minimum value of result will be 1 at this point
; result = result + (result * PctMenLost) * PctMenRemainingMod
; result = result * FireType
CMRandFact=3
; this is used to specify the killing rate in seconds
CMMaxNextKillTime=10
CMMaxKillTimePenalty=5
